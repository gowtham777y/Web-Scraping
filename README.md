# Web-Scraping
In this project I collected data from timesjobs.com website. This data includes the job offerings from companies which include python as a major skill. I also took a skill as an input which is not familiar with and didn't recommend the jobs which need that skill as a requirement. The code refreshes for every 10 minutes. I used Beautifulsoup with python for data scraping. I also stored the company name, Skills required and the job website into a text file in jobs folder.
